<p>The integrity of knowledge creation – and, with it, how we make sense of the world – 
depends on how effectively we can combat the spread of misinformation and democratize access to trustworthy, 
verifiable sources of information to stimulate progress in all areas of human activity.
	Open access to research information is of fundamental importance in this democratization effort, 
	as is the commitment on the part of research and publishing communities to peer review and other methods of 
	promoting the trustworthiness and reproducibility of research outputs. At the same time, we must devise smarter, 
	more fool-proof ways of filtering for truth and discerning the provenance of the information we consume.</p>

<p>The <strong>MIT Knowledge Futures Group</strong> (KFG) is a new joint initiative of the MIT Press and the MIT Media Lab 
	and is supported by generous funding from Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn and a member of the MIT Media Lab’s 
	Advisory Council. <span style="line-height:115%"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"> </span></span> 
The KFG’s mission is to transform research publishing from a closed, sequential process, into an open, community-driven one, 
	by incubating and deploying open source technologies to support both rapid, open dissemination and a shared ecosystem 
	for information review, provenance, and verification. The partnership is the first of its kind between an established
	publisher and a world-class academic lab devoted to the design of future-facing technologies.</p>

<p>RATIONALE<br>
In order for mission driven publishers to flourish into the future, it is imperative that we establish our own innovation pathways. 
	At the same time, universities must assert greater ownership and influence over the ecosystems for sharing and 
	verifying knowledge given how critical it is to their core mission. The development of open source alternatives 
	to the stranglehold that a small handful of commercial entities now maintain on not only the markets for information, 
	but also on reputation systems, publishing technologies, and digital innovation will be of clear benefit to the 
	research community and the reading public alike.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE<br>
The KFG will serve as a test kitchen, incubator, and a staging platform for the development and launch of open source 
	publishing technologies and aligned open access publications, staffed jointly by the Press and the Media Lab. 
	The open source approach not only reduces the precarious dependency that most non-profit academic publishers 
	have on costly outsourced technologies and a limited network of commercial vendors, but also provides a 
	foundation for greater insourced experimentation and innovation. We now seek funding partners to help us 
	grow our capacity over the next two to three years, as we develop the cost-recovery models that will 
	ultimately make the KFG self-sustaining.</p>

<p>PARTNERSHIP<br>
The MIT Press and the Media Lab have a long history of collaboration, beginning with renowned designer Muriel Cooper, 
	who was the Press’ first art director and later a founding faculty member of the Media Lab. Both Press and Lab 
	reflect the values of MIT, an institution that places a premium on experimentation, invention, and open 
	information access. Since its launch in 1962, the MIT Press has been changing the rules of engagement between 
	academic authors and their readers. The Press was one of the first publishers to exploit the potential of the 
	Internet, producing open access interactive books as early as the mid-1990s. From its inception in 1985, the 
	Media Lab was at the vanguard of the technology that enabled the digital revolution and enhanced human expression. 
	Now in its fourth decade, the Lab continues to check traditional disciplines at the door as designers, 
	nanotechnologists, data visualization experts, biologists, and computer interface pioneers work side by side to 
	reinvent the human-technology relationship.</p>
